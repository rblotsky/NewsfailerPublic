$$ How to Avoid Cliches $$
You're |writing a __([storytype]sci-fi,detective,modern superhero,fantasy,thriller,horror,real-life drama,romance,talking-animal,video game,dystopian)__ story!| But you want to avoid using __[storytype]__ cliches in the story. How do you do that?
Well, it's really quite simple. Begin by getting to know various cliches that exist, like these:
- The main character is the |__(dumbest person in the world,Chosen One,Dark Lord,reader)__ and has| to kill the Dark Lord
- The Dark Lord has a single object that contains all their power, |__(eating,selling,touching,staring at it really intensely,yelling "SUS" at)__ it defeats| them completely
- The main character |has __(really cool dogs,video games,technology,superpowers,knowledge)__ that nobody else has| and |uses them to __(hide,gaslight,increase the severity of,create)__ all| their problems
- |__(dogs,the power of FRIENDSHIP,science,the dark lord,the protagonist)__ can solve any problem unexplainably and always behaves differently|
- The dark lord lets the protagonist come all the way to their lair |before actually trying to __(befriend,eat,punch,read a story to,adopt)__ them|
- A character |spends so long __(screaming,eating dinner,analyzing the meaning of the story,making a decision)__ that| their plan falls apart

Then, always make sure to write your story so that |it __(NEVER,ALWAYS,gets super confusing once it)__ uses| any of them! |__(Easy peasy,The test is in ten minutes and requires a 70% grade to pass the course,Now you've written a good story,Hope you don't screw it up)__.|
