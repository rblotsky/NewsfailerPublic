$$ Here's how to find the sweetest berries this summer season! $$
|Supermarket __([fruit]greenberries,spaghetti,cars,waffles,tide pods)__ might look tasty|, but upon bringing them |home and __(throwing one in the garbage,swallowing a few,burning them,looking at them intensely)__|, you might find they’re more |bitter or __(soapy,just bad,far better,more like an amongus crewmate)__ than| you’d expect. What’s up with that?

Most __[fruit]__ found in supermarkets are imported, |according to __([name]our glorious overlords,you,me,my cat)__|, |a professor emeritus of __(berry eating,tasty fruits,pretending to be an expert on random topics)__| at the |University of __(nowhere,Waterloo,Guam,my house)__|.

“The |big problem is that most people in __([readerCountry]Switzerland,your house,prison,Middle Earth)__ are eating __[fruit]__| grown |in __(your mom's basement,my meth lab,the moon,underground caverns,bitcoin server farms)__|,” they told the Star.

|For the very best __[fruit]__, visit your local __(farmers’ market,sweatshop,among us musical performance,importer)__| for freshly picked, properly ripened fruit, __[name]__ said. If that’s not possible, look for __[local]__ grown __[fruit]__ in the supermarket while avoiding imported fruit: |“Buy __([local]nothing,bilbo's,rotting,crack cocaine,crypto)__ — that’s what everybody says.”| |

$$ When are these they in season here in Canada? $$
Traditionally, __[fruit]__ would produce a crop |in __([month]June,July,January,1880,one week from now)__|, __[name]__ said. These varieties are called “__[month]__-bearing,” and are typically larger and have bigger yields than its peers.

Other __[fruit]__ are everbearers, he continued, which produce two smaller crops. “|__(Breeding programs,selective destruction programs,GMOs,blood sacrifices)__ have greatly enhanced| the flavours and sweetness of these,” __[name]__ said.

Several decades ago, |__(my friend with a magnifying glass,worms,students,aliens)__ found| a trait that allowed __[fruit]__ to flower and fruit all season. |They soon __(ruined other crops too,destroyed the organic berry industry,sold the idea to make millions,told aliens about it)__|, allowing producers to grow the new, "day-neutral" fruit year-round.

“As |long as the __(bloody,economical,educational,extraterrestrial,unsuitable)__ conditions are suitable|, |the __(poison gas content,amount of fires,proximity to nuclear test sites)__| |are __(acceptable,within an acceptable range,extremely high,out of this world)__|, this plant will flower and produce fruit.”
